                     <b>The Merchant of Venice</b> ranks with Hamlet as one of the most frequently performed dramas.
                    Written sometime between 1594 and 1598,the play is primarily based on a story in Pecorone,a 
                    collection of tales and considerable debate concerning the dramatist's intent in the <b>The Merchant
                        of Venice</b> anectodes by the fourteenth-century Italian writer Glovanni Fiorentino.There is 
                        because,although it conforms to the structure of a comedy,the play contains many tragic elements.
                        One school of critics maintains the drama is fundamentally allegorical,addressing such themes 
                        as triumph of mercy over justice,New Testament forgiveness over Old Testament law, and love over
                        material wealth.Another group of commentators,observing several ambiguities in the play's apparent
                        endorsement of christian values,contends that Shakespeare actually censures Antonio and the Venetians
                        who oppose Shylock.In essence,these critics assert that the Christians' discrimination against
                        Shylock which ultimately results in his forced conversion from Judaism,contradicts the percepts of
                        love and mercy.Other commentators suggest that Shakespeare intentionally provided for both 
                        interpretations of the drama:although the playwright does not entirely support Shylock,they
                        contend,neither does he endorse the actions of Antonio and other Venetians in their punishment of
                        the Jew.

                <b>George Bernard Shaw</b> was written this book.This book was published April 21,1894.This book
            was actually historical romantic with comedy.Plot of this book is 1885,Serbo-Bulgarian.Actually i
            think that book is so interesting because in this book,view of love and war is the main think with
            comedic.Bluntschli is a Swiss soldier who fall in love with Raina but she is already angst with
            Sergius,but Sergius love louka.At last the comedy of the story turn into tragedy and story builds
            as we wonder how this love triangle unravel.i think no one can know what hepped at last without
            finishing the story.This book is so interesting.The tragedy of this story is full of comedy.
            Bernard Shaw prove that a romantic story can express with comedy.

        <b>Macbeth</b>,a Scottish baron,and his wife plot regicide after witches predict that Macbeth
        is to become king.Three witches tell the Scottish general Macbeth that he will be King of
        Scotland.Encouraged by his wife,Macbeth kills the king,becomes the new king, and kills more
        people out of paranoia.Civil war erupts to overthrow Macbeth,resulting in more death.Macbeth was
        an enjoyable play for a majority of its Acts.Although the ending didn't land the way I had hoped,
        I might be overlooking some obvious reasons to the events playing out the way they did.If I learned
        anything from the story,it's not to take things out of proportion.

            </a>
        <b>Man and Superman </b> is a four-act drama book written by <b>George Bernard Shaw</b> in 1903.
        The series was written in response to a call for Shaw to write a play based on Don Jualn theme.
        Man and Superman opened at the Royal court theatre in London on 23 May 1905.Mr.Whitefield has 
        recently died, and his will indicates that his daughter Ann should be left in the care of two
        men,Roebuck Ramsden and John Tanner.Ramsden,a venerable old man,distrusts John Tanner, an eloquent
        youth with revolutionary ideas,whom Shaw's stage directions describe as "prodigiously fluent of
        speech,restless,excitable(mark the snorting nostril and the restless blue eye,just the thirty-
        secondth of an inch too wide open),possibly a little mad."

            <h2>5.Othello</h2>

        <b>Othello</b> is undoubtedly a brilliant piece of literature and theatre;it's a riveting story
         the worst parts of human nature that culminates in a satisfying tragic conclusion.And Iago is 
         undeniably a brilliant character;his masterclass in manipulation is mesmerizing to watch.
         But it was a particularly interesting play to read amidst the resurgence of the Black 
         Lives Matter movement,as discussions about Black representation in the media are currently 
         in our cultural foreground.There's a contradiction in the heart of<i>Othello</i>that makes 
         for unsettling reading:Iago,while ostensibly the villain to Othello's tragic hero,is also 
         the character that the audience has the strongest connectionwith through  a sries of prominent 
         soliloquies(that Othello himself is denied);Iago is also a flagrant racist.Recpnciling these 
         two truths about Iago is a challenge,and no matter which way you look at it,it doesn't sit 
         comfortably as we circle this 'is this play racist' question.
